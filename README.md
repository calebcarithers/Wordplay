# Wordplay
Collaborative experience between machine and man in which the user speaks a word into their computer. The letters of this word are then used to form every other word possible. These words are then classified and used to form random sentences (once enough words are generated), creating obscure juxtapositions of words and phrases. By collaborating with the computer, the user is forced to view the machine as a partner rather than a tool.
