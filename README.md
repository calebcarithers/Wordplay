# Wordplay
Exhibition in which the user builds free verse with the computer. 

User inputs a single word after selecting "Listen". This word is broken down into all other words which can be formed from it's letters (anagramica API). These words are then classified based on their part of speech (dictionary.yandex.net). Classified words are added to specific arrays. From these arrays, random words are inputted into defined sentence structures which are then printed to the screen (p5.js).

This version of the project is a proof of concept; it is not ready for full release.

~To Fix~
--> Diversifiy and include more unique sentence structures
--> Use more reliable resource to classify POS of each word (dictionary.com possibly)
